## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Meter HTML Element
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was quite interesting. I debated over using a the \<progress\> or \<meter\> tag and decided to settle on the later and learn how to use it.

Positionning of the ball in the gauge was also tricky, I decided to position it with calc() using the percentage of the value minus some pixels. It allows for dynamic positioning through code later on.

The bubble was also new to me, not so much the positioning but the little notch in the desktop version.
